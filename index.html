        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm currently attending University of California Riverside with a major of Political Science/ Administrative Studies. I have an interest in pursuing politics or possibly a government job in the future. Currently I am just focused on school and getting the best grades possible while still meeting new people and maintaining a social life as best as I can. With a Political Science degree I would be able to one day either join politics, discuss or advocate law, or teach it as a professor/ teacher. I would be most interested in actually joining politics because I am very passionate about certain issues, such as immigration laws and government spending. If I couldn’t hold a job in office, however, I would be happy as a teacher or a professor teaching others about the importance of politics and lawmaking. 
 <br><br>

        Another job that I am working towards is a Fighter Jet pilot in the Air Force. Currently I'm in the ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps) for the Air Force and I plan on joining once my career in college ends, hopefully then able to be trained as a pilot and stationed somewhere safe and useful. If not a jet pilot, I would hope to be able to join as a drone pilot (or RPA) where I could still be useful and have experience in the air, at least somewhat. I would also consider being a mechanic for the aircraft if my other two options become unavailable because I have always been interested in working on cars and motorcycles, so hopefully I would be able to quickly learn the skills needed to properly maintain aircraft. The Air Force is a good path out of college because it's a guaranteed job for at least four years, it provides housing and food pay so that I don’t have to worry about a living situation, and it will very well prepare me for my future in other career fields. Most employers consider Military veterans good options for high paying jobs because they usually understand hard work and commitment as well as dedication and honesty. 
<br><br>

        My status as a student is not all I have currently under my belt, however, as I have also held two previous jobs. In high school i worked at a Starbucks for almost a year and learned how to handle customers, make drinks, and take orders at the same time, as we were constantly multi-tasking. Another important thing I learned is that sometimes you need to work alone and although it will be stressful it is possible to succeed under high pressure. I also learned from that job how important it is to create relationships with coworkers or team members because it's easier to work with people that you like, you need to be able to trust one another, and it's good to have someone's back as well as they have yours. The other job I worked at was a Garage Door company that was mostly low-level construction work or helping in the office with answering phone calls or creating CAD drawings, all of these new experiences for me. This job taught me how important it is to be able to learn new things quickly so that you can always be helping and a useful part of the team.
